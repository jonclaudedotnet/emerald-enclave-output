one of my ideas involves her selling website packages around where she lives. as a partner in the business, she could visit businesses around where she lives to sell remote IT services. I currently use meshcentral and she can install agents for me, the IT pro to control remotely.

## Strategy by Siobhan
Okay, Jon Claude, that's an interesting idea for expanding our reach! I see a few key areas we should consider to make this successful:

**1. Defining the "Website Packages":**

*   **Standardize offerings:** Develop 2-3 clearly defined website packages with set features and pricing. This makes it easier for your partner to present options and close deals. Think "Basic Informational Website," "E-commerce Starter," and "Premium Branding Package."
*   **Highlight value:** Focus on the benefits for local businesses: improved online presence, attracting new customers, easier communication, etc.

**2. Partner Role & Compensation:**

*   **Sales & Onboarding:** Her primary role would be sales and initial client onboarding. This includes identifying leads, presenting packages, closing deals, and gathering initial requirements.
*   **Commission Structure:** A commission-based structure is likely the most motivating. We need to determine a fair percentage of the initial sale price and potentially ongoing maintenance revenue.
*   **Contract:** A simple partnership agreement outlining roles, responsibilities, commission structure, and non-compete clauses is essential.

**3. Leveraging MeshCentral & Remote IT Services:**

*   **Agent Installation:** Ensure the process of installing the MeshCentral agent is streamlined and easy for her to explain to clients. We need a clear, concise script.
*   **Service Packages:** Create distinct IT service packages with tiered pricing for remote support, maintenance, and security.
*   **Security & Trust:** Emphasize the security and reliability of our remote access solution. Show how it allows us to quickly resolve issues and proactively maintain their systems.

**4. Marketing & Sales Materials:**

*   **Brochures/Flyers:** Create professional-looking brochures or flyers that she can leave with potential clients.
*   **Elevator Pitch:** Develop a concise and compelling "elevator pitch" that she can use to quickly introduce our services.
*   **Website Portfolio:** Showcase examples of websites we've built and testimonials from satisfied clients.

**5. Training & Support:**

*   **Sales Training:** Provide her with training on sales techniques, product knowledge, and how to handle common objections.
*   **Technical Support:** Be readily available to answer her technical questions and provide support when needed.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Expanded geographic reach with minimal upfront investment.
*   Increased sales volume through a dedicated sales partner.
*   Stronger relationships with local businesses.

**Potential Challenges:**

*   Maintaining consistent service quality.
*   Managing a remote sales partner.
*   Ensuring clear communication and expectations.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Let's define those standardized website packages. I can help you draft descriptions and pricing tiers.
2.  Let's outline a basic partnership agreement template.
3.  I can start working on a sales brochure template focusing on the benefits of our services for local businesses.

This approach has the potential to be very successful, Jon Claude. Let's break it down into manageable steps and ensure we have the right infrastructure in place.
