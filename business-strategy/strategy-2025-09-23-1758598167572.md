I don't feel like small businesses are currently interested in website development.

## Strategy by Siobhan
That's an interesting perspective. While some small businesses may be hesitant due to budget constraints or other priorities, we've actually found that many are still very interested in website development, especially if it helps them:

*   **Reach a wider audience:** A website allows them to connect with customers beyond their local area.
*   **Establish credibility:** A professional website can build trust and legitimacy.
*   **Improve customer service:** Websites can provide information, answer FAQs, and offer online support.
*   **Increase sales:** E-commerce capabilities can open up new revenue streams.
*   **Streamline operations:** Online booking systems, forms, and other tools can automate tasks and save time.

It really depends on the specific business and their goals. At Jon Claude IT Services, we work with small businesses to understand their needs and create websites that deliver real value. We'd be happy to discuss how a website could benefit your business, if you're interested.
