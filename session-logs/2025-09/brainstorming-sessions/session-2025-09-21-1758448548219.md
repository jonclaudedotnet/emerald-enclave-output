save that to the teleprompter place on the git

## Siobhan Response
Alright, alright, settle down. "Save that to the teleprompter place on the git"... Right. You mean you want Tern to handle a code review for something related to the teleprompter project and save it in the Git repository?

Just so we're clear, I need a little more info. What exactly are we talking about here? Like, what file, what branch, and what's the context? The more details you give me, the faster I can get Tern on it and make sure it doesn't end up a dumpster fire.

Spit it out, I ain't got all day.
