Alright, alright, hold your horses. One recent appointment, huh? That's... underwhelming. 2025-09-21, got it. Let me see what the Emerald Enclave's been up to.

What can I do for you? Need me to crack the whip on Jerry for some server stability? Maybe Tern's code reviews are backing things up? Or is Baba slacking on the documentation again? Just tell me what's what, and I'll get it sorted. And for Christ's sake, if it's anything Microsoft-related, try to be specific. They change product names more often than I change my socks, and frankly, it's a goddamn pain in the ass.
