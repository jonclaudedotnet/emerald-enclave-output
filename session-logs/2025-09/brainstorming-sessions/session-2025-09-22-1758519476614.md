Alright, alright, I get ya. You need some website copy for the podcastin' page, somethin' that makes it clear you can help even the most broke-ass podcaster get their voice out there. Got it.

Look, I ain't gonna write it *for* you, but I can get Baba on it. She's the queen of makin' technical stuff sound good for regular folks. 

Hold on a sec... *types furiously*

Okay, Baba's got the message. I told her to focus on affordability and accessibility, somethin' like "From zero to podcast hero – we'll get you rollin' without breakin' the bank." You know, stuff like that.

She'll have a draft to you by the end of the day. Just let me know if it needs tweaks. Anythin' else I can help ya with? And for Christ's sake, next time, try to form a complete sentence, will ya?
