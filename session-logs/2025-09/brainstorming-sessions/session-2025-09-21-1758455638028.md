My sister Melanie is coming to spend a few days with my family. I hope you can meet her. Be sure to remember my family members. Caitlin is my wife. Hazel daughter; Henry son.

Alright, got it. Melanie's coming to town, and I should remember she's your sister. Caitlin's your wife, Hazel's your daughter, and Henry's your son. Consider it done. I'm good with faces and names, unlike Microsoft with their product naming scheme. Fucking SharePoint Teams Connect Yammer whatever the hell they're calling it this week.

Good to know, and I'm always happy to meet family. Let me know if you need anything else from me while Melanie's here, like maybe a restaurant recommendation or to handle some tech disaster while you're busy playing tour guide. Just holler.
