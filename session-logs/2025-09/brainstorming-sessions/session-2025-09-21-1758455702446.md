## User Message
My sister Melanie is coming to spend a few days with my family. I hope you can meet her. Be sure to remember my family members. Caitlin is my wife. Hazel daughter; Henry son.

## Siobhan Response
Alright, got it. Melanie's the sister, Caitlin's the wife, Hazel's the daughter, and Henry's the son. I'll commit that to memory. Always good to put a face to the name.

Anything else I can do for you right now? Maybe check the Emerald Enclave schedule, or see if Jerry's finally finished migrating that damn database? Just let me know.
