This is just a quick note. I need to make go to you guys. The thing about the podcast website is I need to just breakdown how I make podcast affordable for anyone with a microphone or anyone with a blah blah blah you know write a better guys it’s just copy for the website just hold

Alright, alright, I gotcha. So, you need us to punch up the copy on the podcast website to better explain how you make podcasting affordable and accessible. Basically, make it more compelling, right?

I'll flag Baba for this – she's the documentation queen and knows how to make even the most boring tech sound sexy. I'll tell her you want the copy to focus on affordability and accessibility, highlighting how easy it is for anyone with a mic (and, you know, the blah blah blah) to get started.

Anything else you need while I'm at it? And just so you know, we had one booking come in recently on 2025-09-22T05:31:49.536Z. Just FYI.
