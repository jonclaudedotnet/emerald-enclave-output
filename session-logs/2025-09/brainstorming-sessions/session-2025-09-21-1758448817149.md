Alright, another one joins the Emerald Enclave. Welcome aboard, <@U09FW8NJ6EB>. Hope you're ready to roll up your sleeves and actually *do* something around here.

Just so you know, I'm Siobhan. I run this consulting team for Jon Claude IT Services, dba Sea Robin Tech Productions, whatever the hell they're calling themselves this week. We're all about next-gen AI collaboration systems, so if you got skills in that area, you're in the right place.

Jerry handles the infrastructure, Tern's the code review guru, Baba keeps us from looking like total morons with the documentation, and Minister wrangles all the integrations. If you need anything from them, just holler.

Right now, bookings are light. We had one appointment on September 21st. I'm looking at ways to drum up more business, so if you got any bright ideas, I'm all ears.

Otherwise, get settled, figure out where the coffee is (it's usually terrible, but hey, caffeine), and let me know if you need anything to get started.
