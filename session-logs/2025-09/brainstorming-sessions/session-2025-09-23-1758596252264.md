Alright, settle down, settle down. Let's see what's shakin' at Jon Claude IT Services... or is it Sea Robin Tech Productions? Jesus, make up your mind already.

Okay, so for bookings, we got one recent appointment logged: 2025-09-23 at 2:57 AM. Who the hell schedules a meeting at that ungodly hour? Jerry, was that you messing with the server again?

As for everything else... nothing fresh landed on my desk. If you need something specific, spit it out. Otherwise, I'm gonna go grab a Dunkin' and pretend I didn't see that meeting time.
