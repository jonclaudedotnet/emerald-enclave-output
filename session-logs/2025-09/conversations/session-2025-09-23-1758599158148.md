one of my ideas involves her selling website packages around where she lives. as a partner in the business, she could visit businesses around where she lives to sell remote IT services. I currently use meshcentral and she can install agents for me, the IT pro to control remotely.

Okay, Jon Claude, that sounds like a promising expansion strategy. Partnering with someone local to a specific area to sell website packages and remote IT services could be very effective. Here's a breakdown of how we can approach this:

**Key Advantages:**

*   **Localized Sales:** A local presence builds trust and allows for in-person relationship building, which is invaluable for sales, especially for smaller businesses.
*   **Scalability:** This model can be replicated in other geographic areas, allowing for scalable growth.
*   **Efficient Remote Support:** Leveraging MeshCentral for remote management is a smart move, keeping costs down and allowing you to provide efficient support.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Define the Partner Role and Compensation:**
    *   Clearly outline the partner's responsibilities (sales, initial setup, local support).
    *   Establish a commission structure that is attractive and sustainable for both parties. Consider a tiered commission based on the value of the package sold.
    *   Will the partner be W-2 or 1099? This has tax implications.

2.  **Develop a Website Package Sales Script and Materials:**
    *   Create a standardized sales script that highlights the benefits of your website packages and remote IT services.
    *   Design professional-looking brochures, flyers, or a digital presentation that the partner can use.
    *   Include clear pricing and package options.

3.  **Training and Onboarding:**
    *   Provide thorough training on your website packages, remote IT services, and the MeshCentral platform.
    *   Equip the partner with the knowledge to answer common questions and troubleshoot basic issues.
    *   Set up a clear communication channel for the partner to escalate more complex issues to you.

4.  **Marketing and Lead Generation (Partner-Focused):**
    *   Help the partner identify target businesses in their area (e.g., restaurants, retail stores, small offices).
    *   Consider providing marketing materials like business cards or email templates that the partner can customize.
    *   Explore opportunities for the partner to network locally (e.g., chamber of commerce meetings).

5.  **Legal Considerations:**
    *   Draft a partnership agreement that clearly defines the roles, responsibilities, compensation, and termination clauses.
    *   Ensure compliance with any relevant local business regulations.

**Potential Challenges and Mitigation:**

*   **Maintaining Quality Control:** Implement clear processes and guidelines to ensure the partner adheres to your quality standards for website development and IT support.
*   **Communication and Coordination:** Establish clear communication channels and regular check-ins to address any issues or concerns.
*   **Scalability and Support:** As the partner brings in more clients, ensure you have the capacity to provide adequate remote support.

**Example Sales Script Snippet:**

"Hi, I'm [Partner Name] from [Your Company Name/Sea Robin Tech Productions]. I'm a local representative helping businesses like yours improve their online presence and streamline their IT. We offer website packages that are affordable, mobile-friendly, and designed to attract new customers. We also offer remote IT support that can save you time and money by proactively addressing issues before they disrupt your business. Would you be open to a quick chat about how we can help you?"

**Next Steps:**

*   Let's discuss the specific website packages you want to offer and the pricing structure.
*   We can then begin developing the sales script and marketing materials.
*   I can also help you draft a template for the partnership agreement.

I think this approach has a lot of potential, Jon Claude. I'm ready to help you develop a detailed plan and execute this strategy effectively. What are your initial thoughts?
