one of my ideas involves her selling website packages around where she lives. as a partner in the business, she could visit businesses around where she lives to sell remote IT services. I currently use meshcentral and she can install agents for me, the IT pro to control remotely.

Okay, Jon Claude, that's an interesting idea for expanding our reach! Let's break down the potential of having a partner selling website packages and remote IT services locally:

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Sales Reach:** Having a local presence in another area immediately expands our potential customer base.
*   **Personalized Touch:** In-person sales can be very effective, especially for smaller businesses that value a personal connection.
*   **Efficient Onboarding:** The partner could handle the initial on-site setup of MeshCentral agents, saving you time and streamlining the onboarding process.
*   **Word-of-Mouth Marketing:** A local partner can generate valuable word-of-mouth referrals.

**Key Considerations & Strategies:**

*   **Commission Structure:** We need a clear and attractive commission structure to incentivize the partner. This needs to be fair to both parties and account for the time investment.
*   **Service Package Definitions:** We need to clearly define the "website packages" and remote IT service offerings. Standardizing these will make it easier for the partner to sell and for us to deliver. Think tiered packages with clear pricing.
*   **Training & Support:** The partner will need thorough training on our services, sales techniques, and how to use MeshCentral for agent installation. Ongoing support is crucial for their success.
*   **Territory Definition:** Clearly define the partner's territory to avoid conflicts or overlap with our existing efforts.
*   **Legal Agreement:** A formal partnership agreement is essential to protect both our interests and the partner's.
*   **Branding & Marketing Materials:** Provide the partner with professional marketing materials (brochures, business cards, website examples) to support their sales efforts.
*   **Reporting & Communication:** Establish clear reporting procedures so we can track the partner's progress and identify areas for improvement. Regular communication is key.
*   **Quality Control:** Implement mechanisms to ensure the partner represents Jon Claude IT Services professionally and delivers high-quality service.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Develop Standardized Packages:** Let's create 2-3 website package options (e.g., "Basic," "Standard," "Premium") with clear features and pricing. We can also define a basic "Remote IT Support" package.
2.  **Draft a Commission Structure:** I can help you model different commission scenarios to find a balance between profitability and partner motivation.
3.  **Create Training Materials:** I can assist in creating training documentation and potentially even short video tutorials for the partner.
4.  **Legal Consultation:** Before launching, we should consult with a lawyer to draft a solid partnership agreement.

This is a promising idea, Jon Claude. By carefully planning and executing this strategy, we can significantly expand our business. Let me know which of these next steps you'd like me to prioritize.
