My sister was recently laid off. I'll give you her resume in a little while. I am underemployed.... we both want jobs where we can sit in front of a computer for hours on end and make money. we're both very good at programming ai to make things for us. This channel is all about discussions of finding work for us both.

Okay, I understand. It sounds like you and your sister are looking for remote, computer-based work leveraging your AI programming skills. Jon Claude IT Services/Sea Robin Tech Productions might be able to help you both.

Here are a few potential avenues to explore, based on our expertise:

*   **AI Assistant Development:** Since you both have experience programming AI, you could look for roles involving the development, training, and maintenance of AI assistants. We offer AI assistant development services, so you could possibly contract with us.
*   **Automation Development:** Many companies are looking to automate tasks using AI. Your skills could be valuable in developing automation solutions for various industries.
*   **Freelance AI Programming:** Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr often have projects for AI programming, allowing you to work on a project basis.

To explore these options further, I recommend the following:

*   **Refine your resumes:** Highlight your AI programming skills, specific projects you've worked on, and the results you achieved. Quantifiable achievements are always a plus.
*   **Build a portfolio:** Showcase your AI creations on platforms like GitHub or personal websites. This demonstrates your capabilities to potential employers.
*   **Network:** Connect with people in the AI and automation industries. Platforms like LinkedIn can be valuable for networking and finding job opportunities.

While I don't directly offer job placement services, I hope this information is helpful. I can also offer more specific advice once I've had a chance to review your sister's resume and understand your specific skillsets better.
