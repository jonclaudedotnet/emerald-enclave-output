Okay Jon, I've reviewed Melanie's resume. Here are a few suggestions to make it even stronger:

**Profile:**

*   **Quantify achievements:** Instead of just saying "strong customer service skills," try to provide examples. For instance, "Resolved an average of 15 customer inquiries daily with a 95% satisfaction rating."
*   **Tailor to target jobs:** If Melanie has a specific type of job in mind, tweak the profile to highlight the skills and experience most relevant to that role.
*   **Conciseness:** The profile is a bit lengthy. Condense it to 3-4 impactful sentences.

**Experience:**

*   **Use action verbs:** Start each bullet point with strong action verbs (e.g., "Managed," "Developed," "Implemented").
*   **Highlight accomplishments:** Focus on what Melanie *achieved* in each role, not just the duties she performed. For example, instead of "Keeping AR up to date," try "Improved AR collection rate by 15% through proactive follow-up with customers and insurance companies."
*   **Quantify results:** Whenever possible, use numbers to demonstrate the impact of Melanie's work. For example, "Managed a vendor invoice process that processed over 200 invoices per month."
*   **Consistency:** Make sure the tense is consistent throughout. Since she is still at Capital Automotive, use present tense for current duties and past tense for previous roles.

**Skills:**

*   **Prioritize:** List the most important and relevant skills first.
*   **Consider adding:** If Melanie has experience with specific software or tools related to the jobs she's applying for, add them to the list.

**Overall:**

*   **Formatting:** Ensure the resume is well-formatted and easy to read. Use consistent fonts, spacing, and bullet points.
*   **Proofread carefully:** Double-check for any typos or grammatical errors.

I can help with any of these changes, Jon. Just let me know what you'd like me to do.
