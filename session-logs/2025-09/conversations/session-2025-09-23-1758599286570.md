## Siobhan
Okay, Jon, I understand. Your sister is looking for a remote, computer-based job and has strong reading comprehension, fast typing skills, and an aptitude for learning UX. Here are some potential paths and action items we can explore:

**Possible Job Titles & Areas to Investigate:**

*   **UX Writer/Content Strategist:** Her reading comprehension and fast typing would be a huge asset. UX writing focuses on clear, concise text within digital interfaces. We could help her create a portfolio website showcasing her writing skills and understanding of UX principles.
*   **Technical Writer:** Companies need people who can explain complex technical information in a clear and accessible way. This would leverage her comprehension skills.
*   **Customer Support Specialist (Tier 2/3):** Roles that require deeper understanding of products and troubleshooting complex issues. The fast typing is a definite plus.
*   **Data Entry/Transcription (with a twist):** While seemingly basic, focusing on specialized areas like legal or medical transcription often pays better and requires a higher level of accuracy and comprehension.
*   **Remote Research Assistant:** Many researchers need help gathering and synthesizing information online. Her reading comprehension would be invaluable.

**Immediate Action Items for Your Sister:**

1.  **Online Courses/Certifications:** Encourage her to take short, focused online courses in UX writing, technical writing, or a specific software skill relevant to her chosen path. Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and LinkedIn Learning offer many options.
2.  **Portfolio Development:** Even without prior experience, she can create a portfolio. For UX writing, she could rewrite existing website copy to be more user-friendly. For technical writing, she could create documentation for a free software project.
3.  **Targeted Resume/LinkedIn Profile:** Tailor her resume and LinkedIn profile to highlight her skills and the specific types of jobs she's seeking.
4.  **Networking:** Encourage her to connect with people in her target fields on LinkedIn and attend virtual industry events.
5.  **Freelance Platforms:** While potentially competitive, platforms like Upwork and Fiverr can be a good way to gain experience and build a portfolio.

**How Jon Claude IT Services Can Help:**

*   **Portfolio Website:** We can quickly build her a professional portfolio website to showcase her skills and projects.
*   **Skills Assessment:** We could conduct a skills assessment to identify her strengths and areas where she might need additional training.
