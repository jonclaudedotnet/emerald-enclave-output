Okay Jon Claude, I've reviewed Melanie Kertley's resume. Overall, she seems like a strong candidate. Here are my initial thoughts:

*   **Strengths:** Her experience in project management and client relations is valuable. The skills in data analysis and reporting could be useful for tracking project performance and identifying areas for improvement within Jon Claude IT Services. Her familiarity with various software and platforms could be beneficial depending on the specific role we envision.

*   **Potential Areas to Explore:** I would want to delve deeper into her specific experience with cloud infrastructure (AWS in particular) and Microsoft 365 solutions, as those are key service areas for us. Understanding the scale and complexity of the projects she's managed would also be helpful.

*   **Next Steps:** I suggest we schedule an interview to further assess her technical skills and cultural fit. We should focus on understanding her practical experience with AWS and Microsoft 365, and how she would approach common challenges in those areas.

Do you have a specific role in mind for Melanie, or are we exploring her potential fit across different areas of the business? Knowing that will help me formulate more targeted interview questions.
