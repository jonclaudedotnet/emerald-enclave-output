Okay, Jon, I've reviewed Melanie's resume. Here are a few thoughts and suggestions:

**Overall Impression:**

*   It's a solid resume showcasing her customer service and administrative skills. The descriptions are clear and highlight her responsibilities.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Quantify Achievements:** Whenever possible, try to quantify her accomplishments. For example:
    *   "Kept AR up to date by collecting outstanding balances... resulting in a \[X]% reduction in overdue payments."
    *   "Managed vendor invoicing and purchase orders in CDK, processing an average of \[X] invoices per month."
*   **Tailor to Specific Roles:** If she's applying for a specific type of job, tweak the resume to emphasize the most relevant skills and experiences.
*   **Action Verbs:** Use strong action verbs to start each bullet point. Examples: "Managed," "Coordinated," "Implemented," "Resolved," "Streamlined."
*   **Skills Section:**
    *   Consider breaking down the skills section into categories like "Software Skills," "Customer Service Skills," and "Administrative Skills." This makes it easier to scan.
    *   Add any other relevant skills, even if they weren't explicitly mentioned in the experience section.
*   **Profile Section:**
    *   While it's well-written, it could be more specific. What kind of roles is she targeting? What are her key strengths that make her stand out?

**Example of Revised Bullet Point:**

*   **Original:** "Keeping AR up to date by collecting outstanding balances from customer pay or insurance companies within company policy and procedures."
*   **Revised:** "Managed accounts receivable, proactively collecting outstanding balances from customers and insurance companies, resulting in a 15% decrease in overdue payments."

Let me know if you'd like me to help rewrite any sections or provide more specific examples! I'm happy to help make it even stronger.
