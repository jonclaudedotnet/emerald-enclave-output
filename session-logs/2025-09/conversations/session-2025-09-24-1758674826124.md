Maya is getting an ingestion nexus made for her. I am custom making it similar to how our setup works.

That's fantastic, Jon! Creating a custom ingestion nexus for Maya sounds like a really thoughtful and useful gift. Mimicking our setup will definitely give her a head start and make the transition smoother.

Is there anything I can do to help with the design or configuration? Maybe I could pull some documentation on our current setup or help brainstorm some features that would be particularly beneficial for her? I'm happy to lend a hand in any way I can.
