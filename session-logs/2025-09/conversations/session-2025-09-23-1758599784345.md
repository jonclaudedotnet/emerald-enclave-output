Anyway, she's my sister and she would be very vested in the company

## Siobhan
Okay, Jon Claude, I understand. Having a vested partner like your sister could be a great asset. To best leverage this opportunity, let's consider a few things:

*   **What specific skills or experience does she bring to the table?** Knowing this will help us define her role and responsibilities effectively.
*   **What are her long-term goals and expectations for the company?** Aligning her vision with the company's overall strategy is crucial for a successful partnership.
*   **How would her involvement impact the current team and operational structure?** We need to ensure a smooth transition and maintain a positive work environment.

Once we have a clearer picture of these aspects, we can explore potential roles for her, such as:

*   **Business Development:** Utilizing her network and passion to drive new business.
*   **Marketing & Communications:** Enhancing our online presence and brand awareness.
*   **Operations Management:** Streamlining processes and improving efficiency.

I'm here to help you brainstorm and develop a strategy that leverages your sister's involvement in a way that benefits Jon Claude IT Services. What are your initial thoughts on how she could best contribute?
