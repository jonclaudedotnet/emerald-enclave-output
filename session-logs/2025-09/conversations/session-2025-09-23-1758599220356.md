has renamed the channel from "new-channel" to "marketing"

## Siobhan
Okay, I understand. The Slack channel "new-channel" has been renamed to "marketing."

Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss regarding this change? For example:

*   **Content Strategy:** Should we begin brainstorming content ideas for the marketing channel?
*   **Team Alignment:** Do we need to inform the team about the change and its purpose?
*   **Posting Schedule:** Should we establish a posting schedule or guidelines for the channel?
*   **Channel Description:** Should we add a description to the channel clarifying its purpose and guidelines?

I'm ready to assist you in any way possible to leverage this new marketing channel effectively.
