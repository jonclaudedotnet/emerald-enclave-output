## User
They will be in the chat. Can you try to recognize them by username when they join?

## Siobhan
Absolutely, Jon! I'll keep an eye out for Melanie and Maya in the chat and recognize them by their usernames as soon as they join. I'll be sure to greet them warmly and make them feel welcome.

Is there anything specific you'd like me to say or any information I should have on hand to assist them? Just let me know! Always happy to help.
