Since youâ€™ve read it, tell me instead how she could help sell website development packages 

## Siobhan
Okay, Jon! Since I've reviewed the website development package info, here's how I think we can boost sales:

**Focus on the "Why"**

*   **Highlight Business Benefits:** Instead of just listing features, emphasize how a new website translates to tangible business results. Think: "Increase leads by X%," "Boost online sales," or "Improve brand credibility."
*   **Target Pain Points:** Address common website-related frustrations. Are customers struggling with outdated designs, poor mobile experiences, or difficulty updating content? We can solve those problems.

**Refine the Messaging**

*   **Clear and Concise Language:** Avoid technical jargon. Use language that resonates with small business owners who might not be tech-savvy.
*   **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Use before-and-after examples of website transformations. Showcase the impact a professional website can have.
*   **Create a Sense of Urgency:** Limited-time offers or highlighting the risks of having an outdated website can encourage quicker decisions.

**Enhance the Sales Process**

*   **Offer a Free Consultation:** Provide a no-obligation consultation to assess a potential client's needs and demonstrate our expertise.
*   **Develop Targeted Packages:** Create different website packages to cater to various budgets and requirements. Offer add-ons like SEO optimization or content creation.
*   **Follow-Up Strategy:** Implement a system for following up with leads. Personalized emails or phone calls can make a big difference.

**Leverage Existing Resources**

*   **Testimonials and Case Studies:** Showcase successful website projects we've completed. Testimonials build trust and credibility.
*   **Content Marketing:** Create blog posts or articles on topics related to website design and development. This positions us as thought leaders and attracts potential clients.

**Example copy:**
"Is your website working *for* you, or against you? At Jon Claude IT Services, we don't just build websites, we build online success stories. Let us transform your online presence into a lead-generating, customer-attracting machine."

What do you think, Jon? I'm ready to help refine this further or create some marketing copy when you're ready.
