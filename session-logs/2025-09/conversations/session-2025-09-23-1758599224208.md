one of my ideas involves her selling website packages around where she lives. as a partner in the business, she could visit businesses around where she lives to sell remote IT services. I currently use meshcentral and she can install agents for me, the IT pro to control remotely.

Okay, Jon Claude, that sounds like a potentially solid expansion strategy. Here's a breakdown of the idea and some things to consider:

**The Core Idea:**

*   **Partner Model:** Partner with someone who lives in a specific area.
*   **Localized Sales:** The partner focuses on selling website packages and IT services within their geographic area.
*   **Remote Service Delivery:** You leverage MeshCentral for remote IT support and management, handling the technical aspects.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Reach:** Expands your service area without needing a physical office in each location.
*   **Leveraged Network:** The partner likely has existing contacts and knowledge of the local business landscape.
*   **Scalability:** Easier to replicate this model in multiple locations.
*   **Cost-Effective:** Avoids the overhead of hiring employees and renting office space.

**Key Considerations and Action Items:**

1.  **Partner Selection:**
    *   **Ideal Profile:** What skills, experience, and personality traits are you looking for in a partner? Sales experience is crucial.
    *   **Training:** How will you train the partner on your services, pricing, and sales process?
    *   **Commission Structure:** What commission structure will incentivize the partner while ensuring profitability for you? Be clear on payment terms.
    *   **Legal Agreement:** A formal partnership agreement is essential to protect both parties. It should cover responsibilities, revenue sharing, termination clauses, etc.

2.  **Service Packages:**
    *   **Website Packages:** Define clear website packages with varying features and price points. This makes it easier for the partner to sell.
    *   **IT Service Packages:** Outline specific IT services you'll offer (e.g., monthly maintenance, security updates, troubleshooting) and their pricing.
    *   **Marketing Materials:** Provide the partner with brochures, flyers, and a sales script to help them effectively communicate your services.

3.  **MeshCentral Setup:**
    *   **Agent Installation:** Create a streamlined process for the partner to install MeshCentral agents on client devices.
    *   **Security:** Ensure the MeshCentral setup is secure and that client data is protected.

4.  **Marketing & Sales Strategy:**
    *   **Target Market:** Identify the ideal target market within the partner's location (e.g., small businesses, restaurants, retail stores).
    *   **Sales Approach:** Will the partner focus on cold calling, networking, or a combination of both?
    *   **Online Presence:** Create a local online presence for the partner (e.g., a dedicated landing page on your website).

5.  **Support and Communication:**
    *   **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule regular check-ins with the partner to provide support, answer questions, and track progress.
    *   **Communication Channels:** Establish clear communication channels (e.g., phone, email, instant messaging).

**Next Steps:**

*   **Define the ideal partner profile.**
*   **Develop a sample partnership agreement.**
*   **Create a basic sales script and marketing materials.**
