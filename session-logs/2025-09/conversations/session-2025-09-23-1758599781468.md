Anyway, she's my sister and she would be very vested in the company

Okay, Jon Claude, I understand. Having your sister involved could be a great asset. To best leverage her potential contribution, let's consider a few things:

*   **What are her skills and experience?** Identifying her strengths will help determine where she can best contribute. Does she have a background in marketing, sales, technical support, or something else entirely?

*   **What role would she ideally fill?** Thinking about the company's current needs and her skillset, what role would be the best fit? This could be a defined position or a more project-based role.

*   **What are your expectations for her involvement?** Discussing expectations upfront regarding time commitment, responsibilities, and compensation is crucial for a smooth working relationship.

Once we have a clearer picture of these aspects, we can start mapping out how she can contribute to Jon Claude IT Services and Sea Robin Tech Productions most effectively.

For example, if she has marketing experience, she could help with content creation for the website or social media, perhaps focusing on showcasing our AI assistant and automation capabilities. If she's tech-savvy, she might assist with client onboarding for Microsoft 365 solutions.

Let me know your thoughts, and we can brainstorm some specific ideas!
