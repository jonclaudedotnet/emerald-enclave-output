Okay, I understand. It sounds like you and your sister are looking for computer-based work that leverages your AI programming skills. That's great! There's definitely a growing demand for those skills.

Since Jon Claude IT Services specializes in AI assistants and automation, I can offer some general guidance on potential career paths and how your skills might be applicable.

Here are a few avenues to explore:

*   **AI Development & Programming:** Companies need skilled programmers to build and maintain AI models, chatbots, and automation tools. With your AI programming experience, you could look for roles focused on developing these solutions.
*   **Data Science & Machine Learning:** If you're comfortable with data analysis and machine learning algorithms, you could pursue positions that involve training AI models, analyzing data sets, and developing predictive models.
*   **AI Integration & Consulting:** Many businesses are looking to integrate AI into their existing workflows. You could work as a consultant, helping companies identify opportunities for AI implementation and developing custom solutions.
*   **Web Development:** Given your comfort with computers, web development would be a perfect fit. Jon Claude IT Services specializes in website development, and we can attest to the demand for skilled developers.

To help you and your sister further, I recommend considering these steps:

*   **Assess your skills:** Identify your specific strengths and areas of expertise in AI programming. What languages are you proficient in? What types of AI projects have you worked on?
*   **Tailor your resume:** Highlight your AI programming skills, relevant projects, and any experience you have in the specific areas mentioned above.
*   **Network:** Connect with people in the AI industry, attend industry events (virtual or in-person), and reach out to companies that are hiring for AI-related roles.
*   **Online Portfolios:** Showcase your work to prospective employers.

I hope this helps get you started! While I can't directly assist with job placement, I can offer advice and resources based on my knowledge of the AI and tech industry. If you have any further questions about specific areas or need help refining your job search strategy, feel free to ask.
