My sister was laid off recently. She's smart and her reading comprehension is through the roof.  She needs a stay at home job in front of a computer screen. she's good at learning UX and types very fast

Okay, Jon Claude, that's tough news about your sister, but it sounds like she has a great skillset to work with. Here are a few ideas for stay-at-home computer-based jobs she might be a good fit for, given her reading comprehension, typing speed, and potential UX aptitude:

**Immediate Options (Leveraging Existing Skills):**

*   **Transcription/Captioning:** High typing speed and comprehension are crucial here. Many companies need accurate transcription of audio and video content. The pay can vary, but it's a relatively quick way to start earning.
*   **Virtual Assistant (VA):** A good VA needs excellent reading comprehension to understand instructions and tasks quickly. Fast typing is also a huge plus. Tasks can range from email management and scheduling to research and data entry.
*   **Content Editing/Proofreading:** With her strong reading comprehension, she could find work editing and proofreading articles, blog posts, website copy, or even books.

**Opportunities to Grow (Leveraging UX Aptitude):**

*   **UX Writing:** This is a growing field. UX writers craft the microcopy within apps and websites (button labels, error messages, instructions). It combines writing skills with an understanding of user experience. Her reading comprehension would be valuable in understanding user needs and translating them into clear, concise text.
*   **Usability Testing:** Companies pay people to test their websites and apps and provide feedback. It's a good way to learn about UX principles and get paid for her opinions.
*   **Entry-Level UX Design (with training):** If she enjoys the usability testing and wants to delve deeper, she could explore online courses or bootcamps to learn UX design principles. Even a basic understanding can open doors to entry-level positions.

**Where to Look:**

*   **Freelance Platforms:** Upwork, Fiverr, and Guru are good places to start, but be prepared for competition.
*   **Job Boards:** Indeed, LinkedIn, and Glassdoor are always worth checking. Search specifically for "remote," "work from home," or "virtual" roles.
*   **Specialized Job Boards:** Sites like Remote.co and Working Nomads focus exclusively on remote jobs.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Scams:** Be wary of "get rich quick" schemes or anything that requires her to pay upfront for training or equipment.
*   **Building a Portfolio:** Even for entry-level roles, having a portfolio of work (even if it's just personal projects) can make a big difference. For UX-related roles, this could be redesigning a website or app she finds frustrating.

Let me know if you'd like me to find some specific resources or examples of companies hiring for these types of roles. I can also help her brainstorm some portfolio project ideas.
