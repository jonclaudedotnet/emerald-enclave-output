My sister was recently laid off. I'll give you her resume in a little while. I am underemployed.... we both want jobs where we can sit in front of a computer for hours on end and make money. we're both very good at programming ai to make things for us. This channel is all about discussions of finding work for us both.

Okay, I understand. It sounds like you and your sister are looking for remote, computer-based work leveraging your AI programming skills. I can definitely point you in a few directions.

Given your expertise in AI programming, here are some potential avenues to explore:

*   **Freelance AI Development:** Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr often have projects for AI model creation, chatbot development, or automation scripts. You could build a profile showcasing your skills and bid on relevant projects.
*   **AI Consulting:** Many businesses are looking to integrate AI into their operations. You could offer your services to help them identify opportunities, develop custom AI solutions, or train their staff.
*   **AI-Powered Tool Development:** Consider creating and selling your own AI-powered tools or software. This could be anything from a productivity app to a specialized tool for a specific industry.
*   **Data Science Roles:** Your AI programming skills can be valuable in data science roles, which often involve analyzing large datasets, building predictive models, and automating data-related tasks.

**Regarding Jon Claude IT Services/Sea Robin Tech Productions:**

While we don't directly offer job placement services, we are always looking for talented individuals. Feel free to send over your resume. We often need skilled developers for our AI assistant and automation projects. We also build custom software solutions for clients.

**In the meantime, here are some tips for your job search:**

*   **Tailor your resume:** Highlight your AI programming skills, relevant projects, and any quantifiable results you've achieved.
*   **Build a portfolio:** Showcase your AI projects on platforms like GitHub or a personal website.
*   **Network:** Connect with other AI professionals on LinkedIn and attend industry events.
*   **Practice your interviewing skills:** Be prepared to discuss your AI projects in detail and answer technical questions.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. Good luck to you and your sister in your job search!
