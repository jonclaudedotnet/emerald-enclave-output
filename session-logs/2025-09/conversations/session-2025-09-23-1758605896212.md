## Siobhan
Okay, Jon, I've reviewed Melanie's resume. Here are a few suggestions to make it even stronger:

**Profile:**

*   **Specificity:** Instead of general statements like "motivated learner," try to quantify her achievements. For example: "Proven ability to quickly learn new software systems, demonstrated by mastering CCCOne and CDKGlobal within [ timeframe ]."
*   **Highlight Key Skills:** Mention the most relevant skills upfront. "Dedicated customer support professional with expertise in CCCOne, CDKGlobal, and Microsoft Office Suite."
*   **Quantifiable Results:** If possible, add a metric to show the impact of her customer service. Example: "Increased customer satisfaction scores by [ percentage ] during [ timeframe ] through proactive communication and issue resolution."

**Experience:**

*   **Administrator Carolinas Collision Centers:**
    *   Instead of "keeping AR up to date," use action verbs and quantify results. For example: "Reduced outstanding accounts receivable by [ percentage ] within [ timeframe ] by implementing a streamlined collection process."
    *   "Reconciled payments" is good, but add context: "Accurately reconciled over [ number ] payments monthly in CCCOne and CDK systems."
    *   For managing deposits, show scale: "Managed and processed [ dollar amount ] in daily deposits, ensuring accurate record-keeping in CDK and bank documentation."
*   **Collision Center Coordinator:**
    *   Instead of just listing the software, highlight how she used it to improve processes. "Utilized CCCOne and CDKGlobal to streamline appointment scheduling and reduce customer wait times."
    *   For hospitality, add a touch: "Created a welcoming environment for customers and employees by providing exceptional hospitality resources."
    *   For invoicing, show volume: "Managed over [ number ] vendor invoices and purchase orders monthly in CDK, ensuring accurate and timely payments."
*   **Receptionist:**
    *   "Oversaw sales tags" is vague. Be specific: "Ensured accurate and timely processing of sales tags for over [ number ] vehicles weekly."

**Skills:**

*   **Combine and Refine:** "Extensive customer care experience" is redundant. Instead, focus on the years: "Over 13 years of experience in customer relationship management and conflict resolution."

**Overall:**

*   **Consistency:** Ensure consistent formatting throughout the resume.
*   **Action Verbs:** Start each bullet point with a strong action verb (e.g., Managed, Implemented, Streamlined, Resolved).
*   **Tailor:** Tailor the resume to each specific job she applies for, highlighting the skills and experiences most relevant to the position.

I hope this is helpful, Jon! Let me know if you'd like me to help with any of these changes or need more ideas.
