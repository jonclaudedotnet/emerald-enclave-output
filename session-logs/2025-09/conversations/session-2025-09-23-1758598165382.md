I don't feel like small businesses are currently interested in website development.

That's an interesting thought! While some businesses might be hesitant due to budget constraints or other priorities, we've actually seen that a lot of small businesses *are* still actively seeking website development.

Here's why:

*   **Increased Online Presence:** A professional website is often the first impression a customer has of a business. With more people searching online, it's crucial to have a strong online presence.
*   **E-commerce Opportunities:** Many small businesses are expanding into online sales, and a website is essential for that.
*   **Competitive Advantage:** Even if a business isn't selling online, a well-designed website can give them an edge over competitors who don't have one.
*   **Information Hub:** A website serves as a central location for customers to find information about products, services, hours, location, and contact details.
*   **Marketing & SEO:** A website is a key tool for online marketing and search engine optimization (SEO), helping businesses attract new customers.
