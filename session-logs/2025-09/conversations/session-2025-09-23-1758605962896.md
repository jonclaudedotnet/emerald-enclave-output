## Siobhan
Okay, Jon, I've reviewed Melanie's resume. Here are a few suggestions to make it even stronger:

**Overall:**

*   **Quantify accomplishments:** Instead of just listing duties, try to add numbers to show impact. For example: "Collected outstanding balances, reducing AR by X% in Q2 2024."
*   **Tailor to target jobs:** Is she aiming for specific roles? Adjust the profile and skills to highlight the most relevant aspects for those roles.
*   **Consistent tense:** Use past tense for previous roles (Receptionist, Coordinator) and present tense for the current role.

**Specific Sections:**

*   **Profile:**
    *   "Motivated learner" is a bit generic. Try something more specific and impactful, like: "Dedicated customer support professional with a proven track record of improving customer satisfaction and streamlining administrative processes."
*   **Experience:**
    *   **Administrator:** Break down the duties into specific accomplishments. For example: "Managed deposit information into CDK and on bank documents, ensuring accurate reconciliation and compliance with company policy."
    *   **Coordinator:** Instead of just listing software, highlight how she used it. For example: "Utilized CCCOne and CDKGlobal software to efficiently manage scheduling, appointments, and customer communication, resulting in X% improvement in customer satisfaction scores."
    *   **Receptionist:** Quantify the impact of her work. For example: "Oversaw sales tags for vehicles, ensuring accurate pricing and compliance with regulations."
*   **Skills:**
    *   "Working knowledge of Microsoft Office Suites" is vague. List the specific programs she's proficient in (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.).
    *   "Over 13 years in extensive customer care experience" - either quantify it in the profile or remove it.

**Example Revisions:**

**Profile:**

> Dedicated customer support professional with a proven track record of improving customer satisfaction and streamlining administrative processes. Experienced in multitasking, skilled in conflict resolution, and committed to upholding company policies and procedures. Excellent communication skills, able to collaborate effectively with teammates and work independently to achieve company goals.

**Administrator:**

> As the Collision Center’s Office Manager, responsible for all duties of Collision Center Coordinator and the following additional duties: Maintaining up-to-date AR by collecting outstanding balances from customer pay or insurance companies within company policy and procedures.

Managed deposit information into CDK and on bank documents, streamlining reconciliation processes.

Let me know if you'd like me to help you brainstorm specific quantifiable achievements for each role. Also, if you have a job description for a role she's targeting, I can tailor the resume even more!
