So I worked on some good things today. Melanie has her own website where she can ingest all her data for her databaseâ€¦ I set up rustdesk server.

That's fantastic, Jon! It sounds like you had a productive day. Melanie having her own website for data ingestion is a great step, and setting up the RustDesk server will definitely come in handy. Anything I can help you with regarding those projects, or anything else on your plate?
