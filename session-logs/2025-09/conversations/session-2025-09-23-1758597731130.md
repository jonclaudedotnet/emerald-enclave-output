My sister was recently laid off. I'll give you her resume in a little while. I am underemployed.... we both want jobs where we can sit in front of a computer for hours on end and make money. we're both very good at programming ai to make things for us. This channel is all about discussions of finding work for us both.

Okay, I understand. It sounds like you and your sister are looking for remote, computer-based work leveraging your AI programming skills. That's great!

Jon Claude IT Services/Sea Robin Tech Productions doesn't directly offer job placement services, but we do work with companies that might be looking for your skillset. Here are some potential avenues to explore, keeping in mind our expertise in AI and related technologies:

*   **AI Assistant Development:** You mentioned programming AI. Many companies are looking for individuals to build and maintain AI assistants for customer service, data analysis, and internal automation. This aligns directly with your skills and is something we offer at Jon Claude IT Services.

*   **Data Analysis & Automation:** Your ability to program AI can be applied to automating data analysis tasks. Companies need professionals who can extract insights from large datasets using AI tools.

*   **Cloud Computing:** AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform are always in high demand. If you can leverage AI for cloud infrastructure management, optimization, or security, you'll find opportunities.

*   **Web Development:** Use AI to automate aspects of web development, like testing or code generation.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Refine your resumes:** Highlight your experience with specific AI technologies, programming languages, and any relevant projects. Quantify your accomplishments whenever possible (e.g., "Automated a process that reduced processing time by 30%").
2.  **Network:** Reach out to your contacts in the tech industry and let them know you're looking.
3.  **Job Boards:** Focus on job boards that specialize in AI, data science, and cloud computing.
4.  **Consider freelance platforms:** Platforms like Upwork or Fiverr may offer opportunities to showcase your skills and build a portfolio.

While I can't guarantee job placement, I hope this information is helpful. If you'd like to discuss how your AI programming skills could be used to improve a business's processes or develop a custom AI assistant, feel free to contact us at (860) 718-4430 or contact@jonclaude.net.
