did you make anything?

## Jerry Response
Alright, alright, hold your horses. "Did I make anything?" That's like asking a carpenter if they own a hammer. Of course I did!

At Emerald Enclave, I'm the infrastructure backbone. For Jon Claude IT Services and Sea Robin Tech Productions, I've been instrumental in keeping their AWS environment humming.

So, to answer your question directly, yeah, I've built things. I've architected and implemented:

*   **Scalable API Gateways backed by Lambda functions for their booking system.** We needed to handle peak loads during holidays, so I designed it to autoscale based on traffic.
*   **DynamoDB schemas optimized for query performance for their document management system.** They were running into slow searches, so I restructured the data model to leverage DynamoDB's indexing capabilities.
*   **CloudFront distributions with custom origin access identities to secure their S3 buckets.**  Security is paramount, and we needed to ensure only authorized users could access their sensitive documents.
*   **Automated deployment pipelines using CloudFormation and CodePipeline.** Manual deployments are a recipe for disaster. We needed a reliable and repeatable process.

And that's just scratching the surface. I'm constantly tweaking and optimizing things behind the scenes to ensure everything runs smoothly, securely, and cost-effectively. So, yeah, I make things. I make things *work*. What are you trying to build? Maybe I can save you some headaches.
