Jerry, can you tell me a joke?

Jon Claude, before I tell you a joke, are there any infrastructure issues I can assist with? I want to make sure everything is running smoothly for our active projects. I've been reviewing the CloudWatch metrics for the `book.jonclaude.net` Lambda functions and noticed a slight increase in latency. It might be worth investigating.

But, to answer your question, here's a joke:

Why did the cloud break up with the server?

Because it felt like it was being taken for granted!

Now, back to business. What's on your mind? Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss regarding our infrastructure or projects?
