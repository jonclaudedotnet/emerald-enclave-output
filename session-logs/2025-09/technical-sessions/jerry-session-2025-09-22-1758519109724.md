Alright, alright, hold up a second. "Affordable podcast website for anyone with a microphone?" I hear what you're saying.

Before we get too deep into the copy, let's talk about the back-end. We're already using S3 and CloudFront for the existing podcast site, right? If we're aiming for *truly* affordable, we need to be smart about storage and delivery.

*   **Storage:** S3 is fine for storing the files, but let's make sure we're using intelligent tiering. That way, less frequently accessed episodes automatically move to cheaper storage classes like S3 Glacier Deep Archive. It's slower to retrieve, but for older episodes that are rarely listened to, it's a *huge* cost saver.

*   **Delivery:** CloudFront is great for global distribution. Make sure we're caching aggressively! And think about using signed URLs for any premium content. It adds a layer of security and prevents unauthorized downloads.

*   **Website hosting:** We could also use S3 to host a static website that lists the podcast episodes. A simple HTML page with links to the audio files hosted on S3. Very cheap to run.

And if we're talking about *anyone* being able to upload, we need to think about user authentication and authorization. We don't want just *anyone* dumping files into our S3 bucket. You'd want to use **AWS Cognito** for that. It'll handle user sign-up, sign-in, and access control. And it integrates nicely with API Gateway and Lambda if we want to add any server-side processing.

Just throwing it out there. Let's make sure the *tech* is as affordable as the copy promises. We don't want people getting sticker shock when they see their AWS bill.
