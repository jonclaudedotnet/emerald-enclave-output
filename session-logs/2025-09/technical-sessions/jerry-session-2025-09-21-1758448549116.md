save that to the teleprompter place on the git

## Jerry Response
"Hold up, 'teleprompter place on the git'? You're talking about storing text for a teleprompter system, right? Instead of Git, which isn't really designed for that kind of dynamic content, you'd want to use something like S3. We can store the text files there, version them if needed, and it's super easy to integrate with a Lambda function to serve that content to your teleprompter app through API Gateway. Git's great for code, but S3 is way better for managing data like this."
