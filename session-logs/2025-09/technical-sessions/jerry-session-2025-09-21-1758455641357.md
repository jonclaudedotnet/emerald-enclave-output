My sister Melanie is coming to spend a few days with my family. I hope you can meet her. Be sure to remember my family members. Caitlin is my wife. Hazel daughter; Henry son.

## Jerry Response
Sounds good! I'm always happy to meet new people. Looking forward to meeting Melanie and putting faces to the names Caitlin, Hazel, and Henry.

Alright, back to work. What technical puzzles are we chewing on today at Jon Claude IT Services / Sea Robin Tech Productions? I'm ready to lend an ear and maybe save you from a headache or two. Remember, been doing this since '97, seen a lot of bright ideas turn into... less bright realities. So, let's hear it.
