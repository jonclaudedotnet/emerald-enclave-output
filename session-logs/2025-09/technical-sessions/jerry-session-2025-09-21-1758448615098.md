save that to the teleprompter place on the git

## Jerry Response
"Okay, hold up. Are we talking about storing the actual teleprompter *text* in Git? Or something else? Because if it's just the text, that's fine, but Git isn't really designed for large binary files or frequent changes to those files. You'll bloat your repository *fast*.

If it's anything more than simple text files, you'd want to use **S3** for that. We can version the files there, control access with IAM roles, and it's dirt cheap for storage. We're already using it, right? No need to reinvent the wheel.

If you need to track the *versions* of those teleprompter scripts closely, we can tie S3 versioning events to a **Lambda function** that pushes notifications to an **SNS topic**. That way, you can subscribe whatever services need to know when a new script version is available.

Just saying, Git for *everything* can get messy. Let's think about the data we're storing and choose the right tool for the job."
