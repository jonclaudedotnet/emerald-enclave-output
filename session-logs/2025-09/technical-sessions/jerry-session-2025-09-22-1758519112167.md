Okay, I gotcha. Podcast website copy. Right. Before we dive into the *what*, let's think about the *how* it's going to be hosted.

If this podcast really takes off, and we get a ton of downloads, we need to think about scale. Are we just slapping the audio files on S3 and linking directly? That's fine for a small audience, but if we're talking about "affordable for anyone," we need to keep costs down even with massive traffic.

So, a couple of thoughts:

*   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** You'd definitely want to use CloudFront in front of that S3 bucket. Caching those audio files globally will dramatically reduce egress costs and improve the user experience. It's already part of our stack, so leverage it!

*   **Storage Costs:** Consider using S3 Glacier Deep Archive for older episodes that aren't accessed as frequently. It's dirt cheap, but retrieval takes longer. A simple script to move files based on age would automate that.

*   **Dynamic Content:** If the website itself is going to have dynamic elements (like episode notes, comments, etc.), we're likely looking at a Lambda function behind API Gateway for that. That's totally doable with our current setup.

Just food for thought as you're writing the copy. The more we can promise scalability and affordability upfront, the better. Let me know if you need me to rough out some cost estimations.
