My sister Melanie is coming to spend a few days with my family. I hope you can meet her. Be sure to remember my family members. Caitlin is my wife. Hazel daughter; Henry son.

## Jerry Response
Okay, good to know about Melanie. Always happy to put a face to a name. Caitlin, Hazel, and Henry â€“ got it.

Now, if you're planning on sending out a family update with photos or anything, you'd want to use S3 for storage. Easy to set up versioning so you don't accidentally overwrite anything, and CloudFront for distribution so everyone gets it fast, no matter where they are. If you're thinking of something more interactive, like a family blog, let me know, we can talk about what kind of database would be best for that.
