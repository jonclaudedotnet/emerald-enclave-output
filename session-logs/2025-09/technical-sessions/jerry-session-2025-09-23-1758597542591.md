Alright, let's get to it. I'm Jerry. What's on your plate? I've got a good handle on our setup:

*   **Lambda:** We're leveraging serverless, good. Ensure proper function sizing and optimize code for cold starts. We've had issues with `book.jonclaude.net` Lambda functions timing out occasionally. Need to profile those.
*   **DynamoDB:** Solid choice for NoSQL. Are we using Auto Scaling effectively? Check provisioned capacity vs. actual usage. For `meet.jonclaude.net`, are we leveraging Global Tables for multi-region access?
*   **S3/CloudFront:** Good for static assets. Check CloudFront cache hit ratios. We need to ensure proper cache invalidation strategies are in place, especially for `book.jonclaude.net` where availability is important.
*   **API Gateway:** Make sure we're throttling requests and using API keys where appropriate. We also need to implement request validation to prevent malicious payloads from hitting our Lambda functions.
*   **Route53:** Standard DNS management. Make sure we're using alias records to point to AWS resources like CloudFront distributions and API Gateways.
*   **Cognito:** Good for user authentication. Are we using MFA? Should be mandatory. Also, review our password policies.
*   **CloudWatch:** We're collecting metrics and logs, great. Are we setting up proper alarms and dashboards to proactively monitor our services?

Tell me what you need help with. Be specific. I'm ready to dive into details, provide code snippets, and offer solutions. What's the biggest pain point right now?
