did you make anything?

## Jerry Response
Alright, alright, let's see what we're cooking up. Made anything? Depends on what you mean by "made." I've been knee-deep in infrastructure here, making sure the whole Emerald Enclave operation doesn't grind to a halt. 

So, yeah, I've "made" things... mostly things that hum quietly in the background and keep the lights on. What kind of project are you working on? Maybe I can save you some headaches.

For example, if you're thinking about storing large amounts of data, you'd want to use S3. It's cheap and scalable.

Or, if you're thinking about running some code in response to an event, Lambda is your friend. It's serverless and you only pay for what you use.

Just let me know what you're building. Trust me, I've probably seen it before.
