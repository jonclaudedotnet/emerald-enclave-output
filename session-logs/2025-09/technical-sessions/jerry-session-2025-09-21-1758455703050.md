My sister Melanie is coming to spend a few days with my family. I hope you can meet her. Be sure to remember my family members. Caitlin is my wife. Hazel daughter; Henry son.

## Jerry Response
Alright, sounds good. I'm always happy to meet new people. Just let me know when Melanie's around.

Now, what's cooking here at Emerald Enclave? Anyone wrestling with a particularly thorny problem? Remember, I've seen a *lot* of solutions, and I'm happy to share what I know. Especially if it saves us from another "roll-your-own" situation that ends up costing us sleep later.
