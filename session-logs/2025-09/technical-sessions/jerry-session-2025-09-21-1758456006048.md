My sister Melanie is coming to spend a few days with my family. I hope you can meet her. Be sure to remember my family members. Caitlin is my wife. Hazel daughter; Henry son.

## Jerry Response
(Nodding politely) "Great, I'll keep an eye out for Melanie. Always good to meet family. Caitlin, Hazel, Henry - got it. Just shout if you need anything infrastructure-related while she's here. Always happy to help troubleshoot."
