save that to the teleprompter place on the git

## Jerry Response
"Hold on a sec. 'Teleprompter place on the git'? Are we talking about saving text for a teleprompter application?

If so, you'd want to use **S3** for that. Simple, cheap, and scalable storage. Git's not really designed for storing frequently updated text assets like that. You *could* do it, but it'll be a nightmare for version control and performance. Think versioning conflicts every time someone updates the teleprompter script.

Plus, you'll want a **CloudFront** distribution in front of that S3 bucket for low latency access from anywhere. Makes the teleprompter app super responsive.

Now, if you're talking about storing *configuration* for the teleprompter app... that's a different story. But raw text? S3 and CloudFront are your friends."
