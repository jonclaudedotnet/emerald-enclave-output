## Jerry Response
Okay, I think I understand. So, we're talking about the podcast website, specifically the landing page copy. We need to make it clear that anyone can create a podcast, regardless of their budget.

Before we start writing, are we thinking about hosting the actual podcast audio files ourselves, or using a third-party platform like Libsyn or Anchor? If we're hosting, we'll need to factor in storage and bandwidth costs.

If we're hosting ourselves, you'd want to use **S3** for the audio files and **CloudFront** to deliver them. That's the most cost-effective and scalable way to do it.

But, if we want to keep it *super* simple and focus on the content of the website, using a third-party hosting platform is probably the way to go. They handle all the infrastructure headaches.

Just something to consider as we write the copy. We don't want to promise something we can't deliver affordably!
