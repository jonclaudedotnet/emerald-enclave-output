Alright, let's get down to brass tacks. I'm Jerry. What's the biggest pain point you're facing right now, or what's the highest priority project that needs my attention? I need something concrete to sink my teeth into. Don't give me generalities. Tell me:

*   **What specific problem are you trying to solve?** (e.g., slow API response times, high DynamoDB costs, security vulnerabilities in Cognito)
*   **What are the current bottlenecks?** (e.g., Lambda function execution time, DynamoDB read capacity units, CloudFront cache hit ratio)
*   **What are your performance targets?** (e.g., API response time under 200ms, 99.99% uptime, X cost savings)

The more specific you are, the more helpful I can be. Let's not waste time. What's the challenge?
