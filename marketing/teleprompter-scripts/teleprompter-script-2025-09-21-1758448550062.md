## Request
save that to the teleprompter place on the git

## Script by Siobhan
Alright, chuck. "Save that to the teleprompter place on the git," got it. 

Just so we're clear, you want me to tell Tern to add that to the teleprompter project's Git repository. Right? I'll ping him now. He's probably still trying to figure out what Microsoft's calling Azure DevOps this week. Fucking *hate* that they keep changing names.

Anything else while I'm at it?
